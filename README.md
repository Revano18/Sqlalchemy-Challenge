Station Activity:

-- The station USC00519281 is the most active, suggesting it is likely situated in a region with continuous or frequent temperature recording, possibly due to high relevance in terms of weather monitoring or station availability.

Temperature Ranges:

-- The low, high, and average temperatures indicate that the weather is relatively mild, but it still shows variation. These values provide an idea of the climate at this specific location over the course of a year.

Data Distribution:

-- The histogram shows how the temperature observations are distributed, helping you gauge if there are any patterns or trends in temperature over the past 12 months. If you observe a high concentration of temperatures in a specific range (e.g., 70-75Â°F), it would be indicative of a typical climate for this station.

Data Consistency and Trends:

-- By using temperature statistics and visualizing the data over time, you gain insight into not just the central tendency (mean, median) but also the variability and spread (e.g., outliers or anomalies).

Resource Management:

-- Closing the session at the end is part of good practice for resource management, especially in long-running or large-scale applications.
